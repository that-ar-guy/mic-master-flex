## 💡 Project Motivation
**MicMasterFlex** was born out of challenges encountered during the [*Robots as Furniture*](https://github.com/robotsasfurniture/passive-sound-localization) project at [Brown University Human-centered Robotics Initiative](https://hcri.brown.edu/), where configuring a microphone array for sound localization required precise positioning of multiple microphones. 

Given the complex arrangement, writing down positions manually without a visual guide proved inefficient and error-prone. 

MicMasterFlex addresses this by offering an interactive, visual interface to configure microphone positions on a grid, making it easier to plan and visualize the array layout. 

Additionally, the tool generates the necessary `numpy` code for these positions, streamlining the setup process for audio processing and sound localization tasks.

## 📋 Prerequisites
In order to run the project locally, you must have [Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/) installed.

## 💾 Installation
To install the project locally, clone the git repository and install all dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nicolasperez19/mic-master-flex.git
cd mic-master-flex
bun install
```

## 🏃‍♂️💨 Running the Project Locally
To run the project locally in developer mode, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
bun run dev
```

## 🏗️ Building the Project Locally
To build the project locall, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
bun run build
```

The production version of the site will be available in the `./dist` folder.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
